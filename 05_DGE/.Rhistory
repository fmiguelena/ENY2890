## OPTION A: read in single file with all counts
## (compiled using Google Sheets or Excel)
## set working directory to source file location
setwd("~/Documents/2023/03_CURE/ENY2890/05_DGE")
## read in the already-concatenated counts file
counts <- read.csv("counts_example.csv", header=T)
## if your counts file still has the information for feature
## mapping at the bottom, you can get rid of it using
counts <- counts %>%
filter(!grepl('_', gene_id))
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.18")
